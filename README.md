# bank_project
This project aims to create a comprehensive bank management system using Python and SQLite.



### Sqlachemy and sqlite3:
I needed 1 table for my database:

- First, table client. Where I put, id, username, hash (for password) key and secret key.

#### DESCRIPTION: cs50-python-Bank_simulator
Project Description: Simulating a Bank Management System in Python with SQLite Integration:

The system allows users to perform various operations, including adding clients, removing clients, adding loans, and searching a database. The entire functionality is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, leveraging classes and SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Key Features:

* Client Management: The system provides functionality to add new clients to the bank's database. Each client is associated with essential information such as name, account number, contact details, and transaction history. With the ability to add and remove clients, the system offers flexibility in maintaining an up-to-date client database.

* Loan Management: The system allows users to add loans to the bank's database, linking them to respective clients. Loan information includes the loan amount, interest rate, repayment period, and payment history. This feature assists in tracking loan-related data and generating reports for analysis.

* Database Integration: SQLite is integrated into the system, providing a reliable and lightweight database solution. SQLite offers efficient storage and retrieval of data while ensuring data integrity. It enables seamless communication between the Python program and the database, allowing for smooth data management.

* Search Functionality: The system offers a search feature, enabling users to retrieve specific information from the database. Users can search for clients or loans based on various criteria, such as account number, client name, loan amount, or loan status. This functionality enhances the system's usability and facilitates quick access to relevant data.
* CSV File Export: In addition to database operations, the system allows users to export data to a CSV file. This feature enables the generation of reports or further analysis using external tools. Users can export client information, loan details, or other relevant data from the system to a CSV file for offline processing or sharing with stakeholders.


Overall, this Python-based bank management system with SQLite integration provides a solution for simulating banking operations. Its object-oriented design promotes code modularity and maintainability, while the SQLite database ensures efficient data storage and retrieval. With the ability to add clients, manage loans, and perform database searches, this system serves as a valuable tool for simulating and analyzing bank-related processes.

## About CS50
An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.
Thank you for all CS50.
